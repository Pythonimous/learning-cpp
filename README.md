# learning_cpp
Different pieces of my C++ related practice code.

[crash_course](https://github.com/Pythonimous/learning_cpp/tree/main/crash_course) - tasks completed for [educative.io introductory course](https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-cpp-from-scratch) ;

[kumite_projects](https://github.com/Pythonimous/learning_cpp/tree/main/crash_course) - final tasks for each week of the weeks of [the following specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/c-plus-plus-modern-development), uploaded upon completion with [explicit permission by the course team](https://github.com/Pythonimous/learning_cpp/tree/main/kumite_projects/permission.png), so this is in **full compliance** with [Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code).
